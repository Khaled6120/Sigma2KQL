description: 'Detects one of the possible scenarios for disabling Symantec Endpoint
  Protection.

  Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software services incorrectly implement the
  protected service mechanism.

  As a result, the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM user can execute the taskkill /im command several
  times ccSvcHst.exe /f, thereby killing the process belonging to the service, and
  thus shutting down the service.
